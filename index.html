                My name is Junnel R. Padilla, i was born in the philippines.
                My Career right now is in the medical field. I joined the bootcamp
                to divert from being a pharmacy technician finally do something I 
                wanted to do, which is to be in the tech industry.<br>

                <br>Currently, I have done the pre-work which is to created a study
                guide website where i have to build, style a layout of the webpage.
                The challenge 1 project is a little bit different given that we dont
                have to do the code from scratch, instead to change non-semantic 
                elements to semantic. Click on my avatar next to my name to view my 
                instagram page.
